Moved to a new blogging platform called [jekyll]. Pretty slick little system as it generates static websites that can then be hosted pretty much anywhere. I am using [github pages] right now and it seems to be working pretty well.

I might move over my posts from my other blog over eventually, but there really wasn't much there to begin with. I had my An Event Apart conference notes from almost 3 years ago and my CR-48 unboxing from the same time period. Basically I stopped writing there as soon as I got my job with Amazon.com.

Up here I am going to basically write every once in while about programming, photography, or gaming just so that I can vent every once in while.
